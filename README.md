# ‚ú® So you want to run an audit

This `README.md` contains a set of checklists for our audit collaboration. This is your audit repo, which is used for scoping your audit and for providing information to wardens

Some of the checklists in this doc are for our scouts and some of them are for **you as the audit sponsor (‚≠êÔ∏è)**.

---

# Repo setup

## ‚≠êÔ∏è Sponsor: Add code to this repo

- [ ] Create a PR to this repo with the below changes:
- [ ] Confirm that this repo is a self-contained repository with working commands that will build (at least) all in-scope contracts, and commands that will run tests producing gas reports for the relevant contracts.
- [ ] Please have final versions of contracts and documentation added/updated in this repo **no less than 48 business hours prior to audit start time.**
- [ ] Be prepared for a üö®code freezeüö® for the duration of the audit ‚Äî important because it establishes a level playing field. We want to ensure everyone's looking at the same code, no matter when they look during the audit. (Note: this includes your own repo, since a PR can leak alpha to our wardens!)

## ‚≠êÔ∏è Sponsor: Repo checklist

- [ ] Modify the [Overview](#overview) section of this `README.md` file. Describe how your code is supposed to work with links to any relevant documentation and any other criteria/details that the auditors should keep in mind when reviewing. (Here are two well-constructed examples: [Ajna Protocol](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-05-ajna) and [Maia DAO Ecosystem](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-05-maia))
- [ ] Optional: pre-record a high-level overview of your protocol (not just specific smart contract functions). This saves wardens a lot of time wading through documentation.
- [ ] Review and confirm the details created by the Scout (technical reviewer) who was assigned to your contest. *Note: any files not listed as "in scope" will be considered out of scope for the purposes of judging, even if the file will be part of the deployed contracts.*

**Note re: risk level upgrades/downgrades**

Two important notes about judging phase risk adjustments: 
- High- or Medium-risk submissions downgraded to Low-risk (QA) will be ineligible for awards.
- Upgrading a Low-risk finding from a QA report to a Medium- or High-risk finding is not supported.

As such, wardens are encouraged to select the appropriate risk level carefully during the submission phase.

## Automated Findings / Publicly Known Issues

The 4naly3er report can be found [here](https://github.com/code-423n4/2025-02-thorwallet/blob/main/4naly3er-report.md).



_Note for C4 wardens: Anything included in this `Automated Findings / Publicly Known Issues` section is considered a publicly known issue and is ineligible for awards._

When getting a quote to merge TGT to TITN, the quote might lose precision and leave some decimals out. This is ok as they are very small amount.

The TITN token will be deployed on Arbitrum and Base, on Arbitrum. In the contract, the Arbitrum chain ID is hardcoded. This is ok for our use case.

‚úÖ SCOUTS: Please format the response above üëÜ so its not a wall of text and its readable.

# Additional context

## Main invariants

Unless enabled (or the user is the admin), users who merge their TGT to TITN should not be able to transfer them to any address other than the LayerZero endpoint or a specified contract address `transferAllowedContract`.

‚úÖ SCOUTS: Please format the response above üëÜ so its not a wall of text and its readable.

## Attack ideas (where to focus for bugs)
Will everyone who decides to deposit TGT and leave them in the contract for 12 months be able to get their share of TITN plus any remaining TITN left proportional to their deposit?

The TITN token on Arbitrum should not allow transfer of tokens to any address other than the LayerZero endpoint (there are exceptions for the owner and a flag that can be set by the owner to enable and disable this feature).

‚úÖ SCOUTS: Please format the response above üëÜ so its not a wall of text and its readable.

## All trusted roles in the protocol

‚úÖ SCOUTS: Please format the response above üëÜ using the template belowüëá

| Role                                | Description                       |
| --------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Owner                          | Has superpowers                |
| Administrator                             | Can change fees                       |

## Describe any novel or unique curve logic or mathematical models implemented in the contracts:

After 3 months of the merge contract going live, the quote to merge TGT to TINT will reduce linearly until it reaches 0 (9 months later).
